# Arduino-IDE-autonomous-vehicle-w-BLE

In this version there are two characteristics added instead of one as initially in the main version. One is set to notify the other to write and read in order to do double sided communication with the app (link: https://github.com/atrawinska/BLE_final_app_esp32_autonomous_vehicle). The code was for now tested with nRF connect.
